# A Challenging Benchmark for Low-Resource Learning

Paper: 

LeaderBoard:

### Main idea:

With promising yet saturated results in high-resource settings, low-resource datasets have gradually become popular benchmarks for evaluating the learning ability of advanced neural networks (e.g., BigBench, superGLUE). Some models even surpass humans according to benchmark test results. 

#### Hard-Bench (Loss)

For each label, we choose top-k hard examples based on losses scores.

#### Hard-Bench (GradNorm)

For each label, we choose top-k hard examples based on gradient norm scores.
